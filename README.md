# Find out which accounts don't follow you back on Instagram </3

1. Log into Instagram and follow the instructions given [here](https://help.instagram.com/181231772500920) to download your data. Make sure to select the JSON format. It usually takes less than 10-15 minutes to receive the email with the download link.
2. Download the zipped folder from the link sent to you by Instagram and extract the files.
3. Open the folder and navigate to the "followers_and_following" folder. There you can find the necessary files "followers.json" and "following.json".
4. Create a new folder anywhere on your computer and copy the two files into that new folder.
5. Copy the script from "main.py" into that same folder.
6. Run "main.py" using an IDE of your choice.
